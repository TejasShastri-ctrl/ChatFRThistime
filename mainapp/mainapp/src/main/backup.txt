spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
postgres scope = provided
The issue I'm facing likely arises because of the provided scope for the PostgreSQL dependency in your pom.xml. The provided scope means that the dependency is expected to be present in the runtime environment but is not included in your application's packaged artifact. This can cause issues when running the application locally, as Hibernate won't be able to connect to PostgreSQL.
